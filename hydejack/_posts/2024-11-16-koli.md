## Koli Calling 2024 Trip Report

I caught the IC1 train at 6:54 AM from Helsinki Central Station with VR. As someone who pays close attention to app usability, I was genuinely impressed with Finland's train service (VR) app. Not only do they offer free WiFi on long-distance routes and maintain impressive punctuality, but their app also has an incredible UX/UI: I could see if someone was sitting next to me, access a help chat, track my route, and activate tickets (when activated, the conductor doesn't even need to stop by).

An amusing incident occurred during the journey when a postdoc from the University of Helsinki, who was also heading to the conference, spotted me reading the proceedings. He posted in the Discord: "one laptop with an ACM paper open spotted in the train." I turned around, and we ended up having coffee while discussing our projects.

## Thursday: Arriving at Koli

I arrived at Koli on a bus that was waiting for us in Joensuu - everything was incredibly well-organized. Koli is a special place, situated in Koli National Park, a location of great historical and cultural significance for the Finnish people. It has inspired artists, writers, and composers like Jean Sibelius, who found creativity in its beauty. Today, Koli remains an emblem of Finnish identity and a reminder of the relationship between humans and their natural environment.

First of all, they welcomed us with lunch with these views.
