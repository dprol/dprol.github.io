## Koli Calling 2024 Trip Report

I caught the IC1 train at 6:54 AM from Helsinki Central Station with VR. As someone who pays close attention to app usability, I was genuinely impressed with Finland's train service (VR) app. Not only do they offer free WiFi on long-distance routes and maintain impressive punctuality, but their app also has an incredible UX/UI: I could see if someone was sitting next to me, access a help chat, track my route, and activate tickets (when activated, the conductor doesn't even need to stop by).

An amusing incident occurred during the journey when a postdoc from the University of Helsinki, who was also heading to the conference, spotted me reading the proceedings. He posted in the Discord: "one laptop with an ACM paper open spotted in the train." I turned around, and we ended up having coffee while discussing our projects.

## Thursday: Arriving at Koli

I arrived at Koli on a bus that was waiting for us in Joensuu - everything was incredibly well-organized. Koli is a special place, situated in Koli National Park, a location of great historical and cultural significance for the Finnish people. It has inspired artists, writers, and composers like Jean Sibelius, who found creativity in its beauty. Today, Koli remains an emblem of Finnish identity and a reminder of the relationship between humans and their natural environment.

First of all, they welcomed us with lunch with these views.

#### Opening session

Then we dove right in. Juho Leinonen and Andreas Mühling did the introduction with a nice tribute to Brett Becker, a researcher who passed away very recently, a great loss for the CSEd research community.

Then they gave us some interesting data: this conference is organized jointly by the Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education / Kiel University (Germany), Aalto University and the University of Eastern Finland (Finland). This year there are 74 participants of which 61 in person, from all over the world (Germany, USA, Netherlands, Switzerland...).

#### Session 1 (Regular): Problem Solving and Understanding – Session Chair Ilkka Jormanainen

After the introduction, we started the sessions which are the conference's strong point. In the first one about problem solving and understanding, it was Eduardo Carneiro from Utrecht's turn who told us about how students reason when refactoring code. Using the "think-aloud" method, they investigated students' actions and reasoning while improving code.

The second session was given by Imke de Jong from Utrecht as well and was about how Computational Thinking (CT) skills are used in solving Bebras tasks.

The last one was by Joey Bevilacqua from Lugano about understanding programming expressions through the analysis of university exams.

#### Session 2: Doctoral Consortium Lightning Talks and Posters – Session Chair Nick Falkner

We finished with PhD student presentations about various research projects focused on improving programming education, including mobile escape rooms, interactive visualizations, industrial code quality tools, and applications in secondary school mathematics.

One could go to each poster asking questions and the research covered from K-12 education to university level, emphasizing different aspects like computational thinking, mental models, and digital humanities.

This one by Naaz from the University of Toronto who presented a way to improve novice programmers' understanding through interactive visualizations and multiple representations.

This other one also blew my mind: it's about integrating static analysis with large language models (LLMs). Their research shows that combining LLMs with static analysis allows significantly improving the quality of suggestions provided to students.
