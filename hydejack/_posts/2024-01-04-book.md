## The Design of Everyday Things quotes

Here are my notes and quotes on The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. My notes are casual and include what I believe are the essential concepts, ideas, and insights from the book, along with direct quotes from the author:

* Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation.
  
* Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,w hat is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned (...). The understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is best done through rapid test of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition.

* Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions.

## Key Terms

* Two of the most important characteristics of good design are **discoverability and understanding**.
    * Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
    * Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
 
* **Human-Centered design** is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition. The results can be products that truly meet the needs of people.
  
* Discoverability results from appropriate application of **five fundamental psychological concepts**:
    * Affordances: relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determines just how the object could possibly be used.
    * Signifiers: communicate where the action should take place. Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it.
