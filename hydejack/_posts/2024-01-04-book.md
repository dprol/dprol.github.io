## The Design of Everyday Things quotes

Here are my notes and quotes on The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. My notes are casual and include what I believe are the essential concepts, ideas, and insights from the book, along with direct quotes from the author:

* Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation.
  
* Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,w hat is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned (...). The understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is best done through rapid test of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition.

* Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions.

* Physical limitations are well understood by designers; mental limitations are greatly misunderstood. When an error happens, we should determine why, then redesign the product or the procedures being followed so that it will never occur again or, if it does, so that it will have minimal impact.

* When people err, change the system so that type of error will be reduced or eliminated. When complete elimination is not possible, redesign to reduce the impact.

* It is relatively easy to design for the situation where everything goes well, where people use the device in the way that was intended, and no unforeseen events occur. The tricky part is to design for when things go wrong.

## Key Terms

* Two of the most important characteristics of good design are **discoverability and understanding**.
    * Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
    * Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
 
* **Human-Centered design** is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition. The results can be products that truly meet the needs of people.
  
* Discoverability results from appropriate application of **five fundamental psychological concepts**:
    * Affordances: relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determines just how the object could possibly be used.
    * Signifiers: communicate where the action should take place. Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it.
    * Constraints: providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.
    * Mapping: relationship between controls and their actions. The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.
    * Feedback: communicating the results of an action. Feedback must be immediate, informative and poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all. Feedback is essential but not when it gets in the way of others things, including a calm and relaxing environment.
 
* Conceptual Models: an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as its useful. Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual models.

* Forcing functions: a form of physical constraint. Situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening.
    * Interlocks: forces operations to take place in proper sequence.
    * Lock-In: keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it.
    * Lockouts: prevents someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an event from occurring.

* 7 Stages of Action:
    * Goal (form the goal) - what do I want to accomplish?
    * Plan (the action) - What are the alternative action sequences?
    * Specify (an action sequence) - What action can I do now?
    * Perform (the action sequence) - How do I do it?
    * Perceive (the state of the world) - What happened?
    * Interpret (the perception) - What does it mean?
    * Compare (the outcome with the goal) - Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?
 
*  3 Levels of Processing (useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion):
    * Visceral (lizard brain)
    * Behavioral (learned but subconscious skills)
    * Reflecetive (conscious cognition)
Design must take place at all 3 levels - do not blame people when they fail to use your products correctly, take people's difficulties as signifiers as to how to improve, eliminate all error messages and replace with help and guidance messages, make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance messages, assume that what people have done is partially correct, think positively.

* Root cause analysis: investigate the accident until the single, underlying cause is found.

* Five Whys: when searching for the reason, even after you have found one, do not stop: ask why that was the case. And then ask why again. Keep asking until you have uncovered the true underlying cause.

* Two types of errors:
    * Slips: a person intends to do one action and ends up doing something else.
        * Slips most frequently occur when the conscious mind is distracted. One way to minimize slips is to
ensure that people always pay close, conscious attention to the acts being done.
        * The best way of mitigating slips is to provide perceptible feedback about the nature of the action being performed, then very perceptible feedback describing the new resulting state, coupled with a mechanism that allows the error to be undone.
        * There are two major classes of slips: action-based and memory-lapse. In action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. In lapses, memory fails, so the intended action is not done or its results not evaluated. Action-based slips and memory lapses can be further classified according to their causes.
        * Mode-error slips: a mode error occurs when a device has different states in which the same controls have different meanings.
    * Mistakes: occurs when the wrong goal is established or the wrong plan is formed.
        * To understand human error, it is essential to understand social pressure.
