## The Design of Everyday Things notes & quotes

Here are my notes and quotes on The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. My notes are casual and include what I believe are the essential concepts, ideas, and insights from the book, along with direct quotes from the author:

* Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation.
* Two of the most important characteristics of good design are **discoverability and understanding**.
*   Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
*   Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
*
