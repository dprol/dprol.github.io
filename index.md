# About Me
For past 4 years Iâ€™ve been involved in helping companies ranging from consumer and SaaS startups (Platzi, Cabify, Glovo) to larger enterprises (Home Select, IESE) with architecting and building their data products. Experienced in product building, software development, and data analytics. I enjoy working with people smarter than me, on problems that need solving.
